# spoke
Spoke is a framework for building interactive speech-enabled web applications. Spoke consists of two overarching components:

1. a Node.js server-side library with a set of modules that interface with a handful of custom speech technologies (such as speech recognition, forced alignment, and mispronunciation detection). 
2. a JavaScript client-side library and framework with a set of tools for building front-end speech recognition websites (such as recording audio to a server, visualizing audio information, speech recognition through browser APIs).

Though Spoke was designed with the needs of the MIT Spoken Language Systems group in mind, it could easily be adopted by other researchers and developers hoping to incorporate their own speech technologies into functional websites.
